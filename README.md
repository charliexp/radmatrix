# pico-led-matrix

Tiny modular LED matrix. Idea is to have a matrix of 50x50mm modules:

- LED modules with a 20x20 matrix of 0603 red LEDs.
- Multiplexer/driver modules at the end of rows and columns
- Microcontroller (RP2040) board in the corner.

JLCPCB Assembly optimized.

This is an electronics learning experiment, will likely fail. I do not know what I'm doing
