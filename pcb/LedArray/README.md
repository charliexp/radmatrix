# LED Matrix module

50x50mm module with 20x20 LED matrix

## Errata

Rev A:

I'm an idiot and somehow managed to switch polarity of LEDs. Rows were supposed to be cathodes, and columns anodes, but it's the other way around. Fixable by a 90Â° rotation, albeit with less than ideal trace layout. Oh well.
